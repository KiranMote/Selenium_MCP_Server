## 🎯 Key Learning: What Makes MCP Server Better

### **Before Our Testing**
```
Basic MCP Server:
❌ Generic error messages
❌ No test context
❌ Single search strategy
❌ Manual evidence collection
```

### **After Our Testing Experience**
```
Enhanced MCP Server:
✅ Detailed errors + suggestions
✅ Test case lifecycle management
✅ Multiple search fallbacks
✅ Automatic evidence collection
✅ Context-aware product verification
```

### **Real Example**
```
Searching for "Sauce Labs Bike Lifftt":

Before: "Element not found"

After: "❌ Product 'Sauce Labs Bike Lifftt' not found.
       Available: Sauce Labs Backpack, Sauce Labs Bike Light...
       Suggestions: Try 'Sauce Labs Bike Light' (similar)"
```
